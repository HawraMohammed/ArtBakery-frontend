# Planning phase:

## User Scenarios:
### User(1): admin
- As an admin, I must be able to create,view,edit,and delete posts about my work
- As an admin, I must be able to accept/reject requests, and I only take two orders per week (ready-made seasonal orders excluded)
- As an admin, I must be able to update the price of the order, after I negotiate with the customer in an external text messages platform (ready-made seasonal orders excluded) and update payment status after he pay

**future improvements**:
- As an admin, I must be able to create,view,edit,and delete ready-made seasonal boxes
- As an admin, I must be able to delete orders of useres who ordered ready-made seasonal boxes but never communicate to approve their orders in an external text messages platform 

### User(2): customer
- As a customer I must be able to create,view,edit,and delete requests I made
- As a customer I must be able to view,and delete orders I got accepeted to
- As a customer I must be able to create,view,edit,and delete comments of any post

**future improvements**:
- As a customer, I must be able to view ready-made seasonal boxes and order at least one box
- As a customer, I must be able to update quantity of boxes in my ready-made seasonal orders
